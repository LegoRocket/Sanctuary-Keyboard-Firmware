### Firmware

Unfinished Firmware for The Santuary wireless keyboard

Based on the ESP32, this is a completely wireless keyboard, to be used however you would like. 

Kits and keyboards are planned to be sold eventually, but currently this repo is to track the firmware revisions, so that it can become a functioning keyboard.

Unfortunately QMK and other pre-existing keyboard firmware is incompatible, leaving my programming skills up to the test. Basic functionality exists, however future features plan to be added, and as the program gets more complex, so does the ability to track changes (hence git)

TODO:
- Implement a better Matrix Implementation
	- Preferably set in a seperate file to setup your matrix
- Implement Multiple Layers
- Implement Battery monitoring
- Implement Different RGB animations
- Implement Colour Brightness (and turn off)

- Document Hardware Changes - seperate file
