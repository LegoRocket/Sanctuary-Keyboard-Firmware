## Firmware

Basic Firmware for The Santuary Wireless Keyboard

All code is included in the "KeyboardFirmwareRev1" folder. Yes, I used the Arduino IDE, but I've tried to document, and separate out the code for legibility.

Based on the ESP32, this is a completely wireless keyboard, to be used however you would like. 

I unfortunately don't have the ability to sell kits or keyboards, but all files and instructions are available in the repo linked above. This repo is purely for the firmware of the keyboard, to allow for others to fork, and modify their own code.

QMK and other pre-existing keyboard firmware are incompatible, leaving my programming skills up to the test. Basic functionality exists, however future features plan to be added, and as the program gets more complex, so does the ability to track changes (hence git). However, I will fully admit that I am not the greatest programmer in the world, and likely don't have time to manage this repo in full, so please feel free to fork it into your own repo.

TODO:
- Implement Battery monitoring (Requires additional Hardware)
- Implement Different RGB animations
- Implement Colour Brightness (and turn off)
